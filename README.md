My final year project: SecureCRM project is Secure web Tutoring management system.

The system implemented in Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework Code First platform, to build a dynamic WEB application that maps the object to operations directly to the database, such as building it. In addition, in terms of security, high-level security principles implemented using the ASP.NET Identity system.
